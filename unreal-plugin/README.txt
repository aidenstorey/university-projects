Demo:

The demo is a potential Unreal Engine 4 use of the ExpBoost plugin with Blueprints. 
The dll's for the demo have been included so the project will be able to open without the need to
rebuild.


Source:

As the plugin is open source, the source file includes the dll for the plugin as well as the source.
To use it place the ExpBoost folder within a Plugins folder in your project directory. For any guidence
use the Demo as an example setup.
